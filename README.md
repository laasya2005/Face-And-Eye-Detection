# Face-And-Eye-Detection
Computer Vision:
Computer vision comes from modelling image processing using the techniques of machine learning. Computer vision applies machine learning to recognize patterns for interpretation of images.

Principle:
The concept of computer vision is based on teaching computers to process an image at a pixel level and understand it.

How does computer vision work?
Computer vision algorithms that we use today are based on pattern recognition. We train computers on a massive amount of visual data.
computers process images, label objects on them, and find patterns in those objects.

Face Detection works on haarcascade algorithm in which the face is recognised by program by comparing the dataset in haarcascade.
